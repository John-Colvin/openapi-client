# OpenAPI Client

The purpose of this tool is to generate client libraries that are compatible with the REST API of a
service, whose interface is described via an OpenAPI/Swagger specification document.

The format of OpenAPI specifications can be found here:

Initially, this library was developed in order to support the generation of a client for the Stripe
API.
